        <p>
            A dedicated Early Childhood Education Teacher since the age of 19 (at the former Meadow Oaks
            School in Calabasas) Melisa Giuffrida sought to establish a similar school experience by
            starting Cornerstone Preschool for her own children. Melisa has her Bachelorâ€™s Degree in
            Psychology from California Lutheran University and her Early Childhood and Administration
            Credential. Founded on the desire to provide a nurturing yet appropriate balance of
            developmental and academic educational philosophies, Cornerstone Preschool was established in
            2005.</p>
